The first thing is to setup the config data

    -> git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
    -> git config --global user.name "name"



Understanding Git environments

    There are three environments in Git

        -> Working area 
        -> Staging area
        -> Commit 


git add . / git add Filename        : is used to move files/changes from working area to staging area.

git commit -m "Commit Message"      : is used to move files/changes from staging area into the repository.





Why ignore files

    -> Could contain sensitive data.
    -> Personal Notes 
    -> System files



    Steps in ignoring a files

        -> Create the file to be ignored.
        -> Create a .gitignore file
        -> Add the name of the file or type of files that you want to ignore inside the .gitignore file.
        -> Save it and push it.






    Deleting and Renaming files

        Delete it normally or use git bash : git rm filename.
