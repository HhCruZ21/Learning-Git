The first thing is to setup the config data

    -> git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
    -> git config --global user.name "name"



Understanding Git environments

    There are three environments in Git

        -> Working area 
        -> Staging area
        -> Commit 


git add . / git add Filename        : is used to move files/changes from working area to staging area.

git commit -m "Commit Message"      : is used to move files/changes from staging area into the repository.
